# oibsip_taskno3
This project aims to predict car prices using Machine Learning algorithms. By analyzing features such as car price, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes, a predictive model is built to estimate car prices. This repository contains the complete code and steps to build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The dataset used includes information such as car brand, year, mileage, transformation, price, and other key attributes that influence a car's market value. Machine learning model Linear Regression was trained to provide accurate price predictions.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.<br>
Feature Engineering: Extracted and selected relevant features like car brand, year, mileage, and price to improve model performance.<br>
Model Training: Trained and evaluated models like Linear Regression.<br>
Model Evaluation: Used evaluation metrics such as R-squared and Mean Square Error (MSE) to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
Python<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
Pandas<br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Seaborn<br>
